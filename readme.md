Roosa Turunen

Todo application with Javascript, html and css.
User can add tasks by writing them in input field. The task can by submitted with submit button or pressing enter key. 
Tasks are then displayed with icons to check the task completed or trash icon for deleting the task. 
There is counter that shows how many tasks are still undone.
The counter rises when user inputs a new task.
If user checks the task as done or deletes the task, the counter will reduce.
The counter will also rise if task that is marked as done is undone by user.
The list and counter are stored in local storage so the page will display the tasks on the page even if the page is refreshed.
If the user want to clear the localstorage that is possible by clicking clear-button at the top corner.

The page is not responsive, so it will not work on mobile or tablet.

I am not fully satisfied but the functionalities work as they are supposed to. 
If I were to do this again I might have different way to approach this task. 
I might do that actually just to learn to do this better and be able to add all the functionalities I would like this to have.
